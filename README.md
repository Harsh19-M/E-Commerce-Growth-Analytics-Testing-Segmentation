# E-Commerce Growth Analytics (Approach & Findings)
A comprehensive data analytics project analyzing website micro-experiments and customer behavior using PostgreSQL and Python, uncovering actionable insights to optimize website conversion, customer targeting, and revenue growth.

---

## Business Context
An e-commerce company aims to increase sales and revenue by understanding how small website changes and different customer types affect purchasing behavior.
By leveraging user clickstream, purchase, and engagement data, the company seeks to uncover which micro website experiments boost conversions and which customer segments respond best to targeted offers.

---

## Business Problem
The challenge is to identify which website changes improve conversion and which customer segments should be targeted for maximum impact.
This project aims to:

- Determine the effect of small website changes (badges, discount labels, product order) on user behavior and conversion.
- Identify high-value or discount-sensitive customer segments for personalized marketing.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to increase purchases and revenue.

## Key Challenges

1. **Untested Micro Website Changes** – Small elements like badges, discount labels, or product sorting may affect purchase behavior, but their impact is unknown.
2. **Customers Treated the Same** – All customers currently receive the same offers, leading to wasted marketing efforts and missed revenue opportunities.
3. **Fragmented Data Sources** – Customer behavior and purchase data are spread across multiple tables, requiring cleaning, merging, and accurate aggregation.
4. **Measuring Impact Accurately** – Determining whether changes or campaigns truly improve conversion requires statistical testing.
5. **Actionable Insights** – Translating data analysis into clear, implementable recommendations for the business.
